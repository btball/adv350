# adv350
Initial upload
Back-port from Mike Arnautov's 660 point version
Compiles (see www.mipmip.org for instructions to convert A-code to C and then from C to an executable) and
can collect all the treasures
To do:
Remove commented code from 660
Verify topology 
Fix endgame
Fix bug in display when a dwarf is killed
Differences from the original 350
Locations, treasures and puzzzles are all the same
Slight change in rug handling 
Command processing from adv660 - so, for example, you can say "get all" and "drop all"
Enhanced descriptions
Slight change in scoring - but still adds to 350 points - made a location "must visit" since in the orgiginal
 version you could complete the game without visiting all the interesting locations
 This also means that blindly following the walkthroughs won't work ...
Hints need to be reviewed and fixed
Some location descriptions need to be fixed
